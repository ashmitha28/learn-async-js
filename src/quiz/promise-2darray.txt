Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.
The calls to sum2DArray() do not yield a result or an error message as they should because the console.log(sumPromise1) and 
console.log(sumPromise2) statements are executed before the promises are resolved or rejected. Since sum2DArray() is
 asynchronous due to the setTimeout, the promises are not resolved or rejected immediately, causing the console.log() 
 statements to display pending promises.
